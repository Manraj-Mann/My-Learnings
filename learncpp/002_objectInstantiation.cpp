    // Data is any information that can be moved, processed, or stored by a computer.
    
    // In C++, direct memory access is discouraged. Instead, we access memory indirectly through an object.
    // An object is a region of storage (usually memory) that can store a value, and has other associated properties 

    // An object is used to store a value in memory. A variable is an object that has a name (identifier).

    int x; // define a variable named x, of type int

    // Instantiation is a fancy word that means the object will be created and assigned a memory address.
    // An instantiated object is sometimes called an instance.


    // A data type (more commonly just called a type) tells the compiler what type of value (e.g. a number, a letter, text, etc…) the variable will store.
    // A type tells the program how to interpret a value in memory.

    // In C++, the type of a variable must be known at compile-time (when the program is compiled), and that type can not be changed without recompiling the program. 
    // This means an integer variable can only hold integer values. If you want to store some other kind of value, you’ll need to use a different type.
